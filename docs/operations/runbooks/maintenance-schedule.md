# Documentation Maintenance Schedule

## Quarterly Documentation Review

To ensure our documentation remains accurate, relevant, and up-to-date, a full review of all documentation will be conducted once per quarter.

### Schedule

2.  **Check for Accuracy:** Reviewers will check for technical accuracy against the current codebase.
3.  **Check for Clarity:** Reviewers will ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
4.  **Check for Completeness:** Reviewers will identify any gaps in the documentation.
5.  **Create Issues:** Any required updates will be filed as issues in the project's issue tracker.
