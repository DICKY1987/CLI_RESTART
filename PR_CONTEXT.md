# PR Context: Merge refactor/ws0-architecture-tests into main

## Branch Analysis

### Current Branch State
- **main** (10ae92a): Latest state including merge train #129 with WS2, WS3 modularization
- **refactor/ws0-architecture-tests** (e4de050): Pre-modularization state with build system improvements

### Relationship
The refactor/ws0-architecture-tests branch (e4de050) is an **ancestor** of main (10ae92a). All commits from the refactor branch are already included in main's history through the merge train.

### Branch Divergence Point
Both branches diverged from commit cd40731:
- **refactor branch**: Added 12 commits including:
  - Build system consolidation (Makefile, removed Taskfile)
  - Linting fixes (Ruff, mypy configuration)
  - Script de-duplication
  - CI/CD improvements

- **main branch** (via merge train #129): Added:
  - WS2: Router decomposition and modularization
  - WS3: Cost & Verification domain split
  - Additional cleanup and test improvements

### File Differences
Despite refactor being an ancestor, there are significant file differences:
- **Added in main** (not in refactor): 
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/domain/cost/` - Modular cost tracking
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/domain/verification/` - Modular verification
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/routing/` - Modular routing system
  - `docs/architecture/BOUNDARIES.md`, `ROUTING.md` - Architecture docs
  - `.github/workflows/architecture.yml` - Architecture tests

- **Different between branches**:
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/router.py` - Monolithic in refactor, modular in main
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/cost_tracker.py` - Monolithic in refactor, modular in main
  - `src/cli_multi_rapid/verifier.py` - Monolithic in refactor, modular in main

## PR Purpose

This PR is created to:
1. Document the refactor/ws0-architecture-tests branch state
2. Allow review and comparison between the pre-modularization (refactor) and post-modularization (main) states
3. Enable CI validation of the refactor branch
4. Provide visibility into the architectural evolution

## Note
Since refactor is already an ancestor of main, merging this PR would typically be a no-op. However, if the intent is to bring refactor's file states into main, it would effectively revert the modularization work done in the merge train.

Reviewers should clarify the intended outcome before merging.
