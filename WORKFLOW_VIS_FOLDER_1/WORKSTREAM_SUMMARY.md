## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-4)
**Workstreams:** WS-01 through WS-04
**Total Hours:** 202h
**Focus:** Schema enforcement, security, testing infrastructure, documentation
**Can Run in Parallel:** All 4 workstreams are independent

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 5-8)
**Workstreams:** WS-05 through WS-09
**Total Hours:** 210h
**Focus:** CI/CD, CLI commands, workflows, determinism, observability
**Dependencies:** All depend on WS-01 (Schema foundation)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 9-16)
**Workstreams:** WS-10 through WS-22
**Total Hours:** 654h
**Focus:** Resilience, parallel orchestration, advanced testing, configuration
**Dependencies:** Complex dependency chains

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Future)
**Workstreams:** WS-23
**Total Hours:** 72h
**Focus:** IDE integration, advanced GUI
**Dependencies:** Multiple phase 2/3 workstreams

## Deferred Enterprise Features (11 gaps)

The following gaps are identified for future enterprise planning:
- **gap_GUI_005** (80h) - Web dashboard
- **gap_ARCH_005** (80h) - Multi-tenancy support
- **gap_ARCH_008** (40h) - Service mesh readiness
- **gap_CROSS_006** (40h) - Internationalization
- **gap_CROSS_008** (40h) - Accessibility (WCAG)
- **gap_DETERM_005** (32h) - Chaos engineering

**Total Deferred:** 312h

These features can be planned as separate workstreams once core functionality is stable.

## Critical Path Analysis

**Longest Dependency Chain:**
WS-01 → WS-08 → WS-12 → WS-15 (Schema → Determinism → Parallel Foundation → Git Integration)

**High Priority Foundational Work:**
1. WS-01 (Schema) - Blocks 6 other workstreams
2. WS-02 (Security) - Blocks 2 workstreams, critical for production
3. WS-03 (Testing) - Blocks 2 workstreams, quality foundation

**Recommended Start Order:**
1. Begin WS-01, WS-02, WS-03 in parallel (Phase 1)
2. Start WS-04 (Documentation) once team capacity allows
3. After WS-01 completes, immediately start WS-06 (CLI) and WS-08 (Determinism)
4. Sequence Phase 3 work based on business priorities

✅ **GUI & UX:** 5 gaps across WS-20, WS-23

**Total Core Gaps Covered:** 67/78 (86%)
**Deferred to Future:** 11 gaps (14%)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Workstreams (contain multiple high-severity gaps)
- **WS-01:** Schema enforcement - Foundation for entire system
- **WS-02:** Security & secrets - Production blocker
- **WS-03:** Testing infrastructure - Quality blocker
- **WS-08:** Determinism core - System reliability
- **WS-12:** Parallel orchestration - Complexity risk

### Medium Risk Workstreams
- **WS-06:** CLI operations - User-facing features
- **WS-09:** Observability - Debugging capability
- **WS-17:** Contract testing - Integration validation

### Low Risk Workstreams
- **WS-04:** Documentation
- **WS-21:** Advanced testing
- **WS-22:** Scheduling

## Execution Strategy for Single Developer

Given the single-developer constraint:

1. **Focus on Phase 1 sequentially** (1 workstream at a time)
   - Complete WS-01 (1 week)
   - Complete WS-02 (1 week)
   - Complete WS-03 (1 week)
   - Complete WS-04 (1 week)

2. **Phase 2 in dependency order**
   - WS-08 and WS-06 are highest priority
   - WS-07 and WS-09 can follow
   - WS-05 provides good testing/CI improvements

3. **Phase 3 based on business needs**
   - Resilience (WS-10, WS-11) if stability is priority
   - Parallel execution (WS-12, WS-13) if performance is priority
   - Testing/quality (WS-17, WS-21) if coverage is priority

**Estimated Timeline:** 23 workstreams × 1 week each = ~6 months (assuming 40h/week and some overhead)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review workstream summary
2. ⏭️ Generate JSON files for each workstream
3. ⏭️ Begin execution with WS-01
4. ⏭️ Track progress and adjust priorities as needed
