## Generation Options

### Option 1: Generate All Remaining (Recommended)
I can create all 13 JSON files in the next response batch.

### Option 2: Generate by Priority
Create high-priority workstreams first (WS-12, WS-14, WS-15, WS-17).

### Option 3: Generate by Phase
- Phase 3a: WS-11, WS-12, WS-13 (parallel execution focus)
- Phase 3b: WS-14, WS-15, WS-16 (workflow & observability)
- Phase 3c: WS-17, WS-18, WS-19 (testing & infrastructure)
- Phase 3d: WS-20, WS-21, WS-22, WS-23 (advanced features)

## Recommendation

**Generate all remaining workstreams now** to complete the full set of 23 workstream JSON files. This provides:
- Complete coverage of all 67 core gaps
- Clear execution roadmap for 6-month implementation
- Dependency-aware sequencing
- Ready-to-execute automation files

Would you like me to:
1. **Generate all 13 remaining JSON files now** (recommended)
2. Generate specific workstreams by priority
3. Review/modify the workstream structure before generation
