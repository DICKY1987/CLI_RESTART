Due to response length constraints and remaining token budget, I'm creating a consolidated summary of the final 11 workstreams.

The user can request individual JSON files for WS-13 through WS-23 as needed.

## Summary of Created Workstreams

**Phase 1 (Foundation) - Complete:**
- WS-01: Schema Runtime Enforcement (46h)
- WS-02: Security & Secrets Foundation (52h)
- WS-03: Core Testing Infrastructure (56h)
- WS-04: Documentation & Code Quality (48h)

**Phase 2 (Core Features) - Complete:**
- WS-05: Schema CI/CD Integration (26h)
- WS-06: CLI Core Operations (42h)
- WS-07: Workflow Templates & Composition (48h)
- WS-08: Determinism Core (44h)
- WS-09: Observability Core (50h)

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features) - Partially Complete:**
- WS-10: Resilience & Circuit Breakers (44h)
- WS-11: Self-Healing Implementation (48h)
- WS-12: Parallel Orchestration Foundation (52h)

**Remaining to Create:**
- WS-13 through WS-23 (11 workstreams, ~550 hours total)

## Files Created in Downloads Directory

Total JSON files created: 12
Total coverage: 34 gaps out of 67 core gaps

## Next Steps

1. User can request generation of specific remaining workstreams
2. Or request all remaining workstreams in one batch
3. Or proceed with execution of already-created workstreams

All created workstreams follow the exact schema and are ready for automated execution.
