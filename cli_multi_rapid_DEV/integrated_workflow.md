# Integrated Workflow: A Detailed Breakdown

This document provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the integrated workflow, combining the deterministic GitHub operations from `deterministic_github_ops.v2.yaml` with the structure of `simplified_workflow_system.md`. Each step is clearly labeled to indicate its nature (AI-driven or deterministic), its executor, and its implementation method.

## Core Principles

*   **Clarity:** Every step is explicitly defined, leaving no ambiguity about what is happening, how it's done, and who is responsible.
*   **Determinism:** Git and GitHub operations are fully automated through deterministic commands, ensuring consistency and reliability.
*   **Traceability:** GitHub save points are clearly marked, providing a complete audit trail of the development process.

## Detailed Workflow Breakdown

The following table breaks down the 25 operations of the simplified workflow, providing detailed information about each step.

| | 010 | Resolve Immediate Conflicts | `work_cli_tools` | ü§ñ [AI Decision] | `aider` / `continue_vscode` | Resolves any immediate conflicts that arise during the modification process. | No |
| | 011 | Apply Formatting Standards | `work_cli_tools` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `lint-all` | Applies consistent formatting and linting to the modified files. | No |
| | 012 | Generate Modification Summary | `planning_ai` | ü§ñ [AI Decision] | `claude_code` / `gemini_cli` | Generates a summary of the changes that have been made. | No |
| | 013 | Syntax & Import Validation | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `vscode-validate-all` | Performs a universal validation of syntax, imports, and types using the VS Code API. | No |
| | 014 | Apply Automated Fixes | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `vscode-validate-all` | Applies automated fixes for any issues found during the validation process. | No |
| | 015 | Run Language-Specific Linting | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `lint-all` | Runs language-specific linters to ensure code quality. | No |
| | 016 | Perform Security Scan | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `snyk` / `bandit` | Scans the code for any security vulnerabilities. | No |
| | 017 | Run Existing Tests | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `run-tests` | Executes the existing test suite to ensure that no regressions have been introduced. | No |
| | | **Commit & Push Changes** | `repo_coordinator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `gh-checkpoint` | Commits the changes to the local repository and pushes them to the remote. | **Yes** |
| **3: Integrate & Ship** | 021 | **Create Integration Branch** | `repo_coordinator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `gh-merge-workstreams` | Creates a new integration branch and merges the changes from the workstream branch. | **Yes** |
| | 022 | Run Integration Tests | `ide_validator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `run-tests` | Runs the full suite of integration tests on the merged codebase. | No |
| | 023 | Generate PR Documentation | `planning_ai` | ü§ñ [AI Decision] | `claude_code` / `gemini_cli` | Generates a detailed description for the pull request, including a summary of the changes and the results of the quality gates. | No |
| | 024 | **Create Pull Request** | `repo_coordinator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `gh-create-pr` | Creates a new pull request for the changes. | **Yes** |
| | 025 | **Finalize Workflow Artifacts** | `repo_coordinator` | ‚öôÔ∏è [Deterministic Command] | `gh-cleanup-branches`, `gh-release` | After the PR is merged, this command cleans up the temporary branches and creates a new release. | **Yes** |

## Configuration and Execution

The entire workflow is orchestrated by a central system that calls the appropriate tools and scripts for each step. The deterministic GitHub commands are executed using the `det.sh` shim, which reads the command definitions from the `deterministic_github_ops.v2.yaml` file.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear and actionable guide to the integrated workflow, enabling users to understand, execute, and troubleshoot the system with confidence.
