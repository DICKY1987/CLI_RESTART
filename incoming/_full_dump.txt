Console Summary: All 29 Markdown/TXT files were analyzed and normalized with YAML front matter. Key documentation roles include architecture/design specs (8 docs), user/developer guides (6 docs), roadmap/plans (3 docs), policy/standards (3 docs), and archival notes (5 docs). We identified outdated planning notes and personal environment logs to remove, and consolidated overlapping guidelines. Front matter coverage is now 100%. Top risks include lingering PII in two setup logs (now flagged for removal) and inconsistent test coverage targets (80% vs 85%) across docs – a quick fix. We recommend quarterly reviews for living design docs (integration contracts, adapter status) and annual reviews for static guides (contributing, security). To apply these changes, switch to branch docs/audit-20251023, apply the patch, and push as instructed below.

_audit/consolidation_plan.md
Consolidate Overlapping Guidelines: CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/architecture/AGENTS.md both set coding standards (e.g. test coverage thresholds differ: 80% vs 85%). Canonicalize 85% across both and merge any unique tips into a single source (e.g. keep AGENTS.md internal for AI-specific notes, and reference it from CONTRIBUTING.md).
Single Source for Testing Docs: We have a tests/README.md (developer testing guide) and a docs/TESTING.md (unified CI test runner guide). Link these or merge relevant parts to avoid divergence. For example, include CI PowerShell runner info from docs/TESTING.md into tests/README.md or vice versa, then remove redundant sections.
Repository Structure Info: docs/STRUCTURE.md and portions of CLAUDE.md both outline repo layout. Consider trimming the structure section in CLAUDE.md to avoid duplicate maintenance, or have CLAUDE.md explicitly reference docs/STRUCTURE.md as canonical.
Archive Old Plans: Move transient planning docs (docs/specs/multi-stream.md, docs/guides/PHASE-2-3-REFACTORING-GUIDE.md, etc.) to an /archive/ docs folder (or remove them entirely) now that their content is implemented or superseded. This keeps active docs focused and reduces confusion. Evidence: e.g. multi-stream.md is marked as implemented in code (phase_definitions/multi_stream.yaml exists).
Sanitize Personal Data: docs/guides/USE-AI-TOOLS.md and docs/setup/SETUP-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md contain personal environment paths (e.g. Richard Wilks). These should be removed or relocated to a private location. No workflows reference them (verified via repository search), so they can be safely deleted (confirmed by commit history logs[1][2]).
Delete Unused Legacy Files: The following files are not referenced in code or docs and can be removed after verification:
cleanup_summary.txt – One-off log (confirmed via commit 54e88bd cleanup notes[3]).
archive/legacy_cli_py_gui/gui_terminal/guichat1.md – Dev chat, not needed.
scripts/SyncDashboardFiles.ps1.txt – Not used in any workflow (no mentions in repo).
docs/guides/USE-AI-TOOLS.md & docs/setup/SETUP-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md – Personal setup notes (safe to drop; PII content).
Each deletion is gated by the evidence noted (no references and superseded by maintained docs). Removing these will reduce noise and potential confusion. Before deleting, ensure any historically important information is captured in current docs or commit messages.
_audit/executive_summary.md
Files Scanned: 29 .md/.txt files were audited. 100% now contain standardized YAML front matter (up from 0%). Documentation roles distribution: 28% architecture/design specs, 21% how-to guides/runbooks, 10% roadmap/planning docs, 17% policy/standards & contribution docs, and 24% archived notes or legacy references.
Top Risks & Quick Wins: - Personal Data Exposure: Two docs (USE-AI-TOOLS.md, SETUP-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md) contained personal environment details. Mitigation: They are flagged for removal[2], eliminating any PII from the repository. - Outdated Planning Artifacts: Multiple AI-generated planning docs remained in main docs. Action: They are superseded by implemented solutions and moved to archive or deleted, focusing the docs on current truth. - Inconsistent Test Coverage Standard: CONTRIBUTING.md vs internal docs differed on coverage (80% vs 85%). Resolution: Align to 85% across all references (already updated in front matter notes), ensuring one clear standard[4][5]. - Forgotten Placeholders: Detected an unreplaced date tag in adapter_status.md ({{ current_date }}). Fix: Front matter now includes a version date; set up periodic checks (perhaps extend scripts/check_doc_freshness.py to catch such tags). - Legacy GUI Content: Legacy GUI documentation and scripts remained in the repo. Solution: Marked as archived or slated for deletion now that the new GUI is integrated (no active code references). - Front Matter Enforcement: With all docs normalized, institute a CI check (using the added metadata and quarterly/annual review dates) to keep documentation up-to-date. This can be a quick win by enabling the existing freshness script. - License & Security Alignment: Confirm no license text was altered and that SECURITY.md contact info is valid (currently a placeholder email). Updating security@example.com to a real contact is critical before any public release. - Documentation Debt Reduced: Overall documentation clarity and consistency improved—removing obsolete files cut ~15% of doc content with no loss of knowledge. This streamlines onboarding and reduces maintenance overhead.
