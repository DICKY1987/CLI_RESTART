## Environment Limitations

This task is being executed in a sandboxed environment where:
- Direct GitHub API access requires authentication not available
- Git push operations are managed through the report_progress tool
- The current working branch is `copilot/merge-copilot-remaining-modifications` (PR #137)
- Cannot directly switch to or work on the target branch `copilot/add-ws-f-remaining-modifications`
