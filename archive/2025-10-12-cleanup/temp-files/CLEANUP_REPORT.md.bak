# Cleanup Report - 2025-10-12

Actions performed:
- Moved to archive: "C:\Users\Richard Wilks\CLI_RESTART\archive\2025-10-12\removal-backup-20251011-160634"

Recommended next steps (non-destructive):
- Review and decide relocation for dev artifacts under `tmp/atomic-workflow-system/` (likely `tools/` or `examples/`).
- Keep `workflows/` as code package (not GitHub workflows). Consider `src/workflows/` later if imports are updated.
- `CODEX_IMPLEMENTATION/` is referenced by VS Code tasks; leave in place or update tasks before moving to `docs/specs/`.
- Consider archiving large, stale directories to `archive/YYYY-MM-DD/` instead of deleting.
